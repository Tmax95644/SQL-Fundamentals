# New York Restaurants Analysis (SQL)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores a curated dataset of New York City restaurants to answer practical dining-related questions using SQL. The analysis focuses on discovering cuisine options, identifying high-rated and premium restaurants, locating nearby delivery spots, and creating rankings based on customer reviews.

The goal is to demonstrate core SQL querying skills while producing insights that mirror real-world decision-making (e.g. where to eat, what’s highly rated, and what fits specific criteria).
