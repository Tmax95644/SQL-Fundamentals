# Lyft Trip Data Analysis (SQL)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes trip, rider, and vehicle data for **Lyft**, a ride-sharing platform. The primary focus is practicing **SQL joins** to combine information across multiple tables and answer practical business questions related to users, trips, and fleet operations.

The analysis mirrors common real-world analytics tasks in mobility and platform companies, such as building trip logs, analysing rider behaviour, and monitoring vehicle usage.

## 🗂 Dataset Description

The project uses **three relational tables**:

### Table: `trips`

| Column     | Description        |
| ---------- | ------------------ |
| `id`       | Unique trip ID     |
| `rider_id` | Rider identifier   |
| `car_id`   | Vehicle identifier |
| `cost`     | Cost of the trip   |

### Table: `riders`

| Column        | Description       |
| ------------- | ----------------- |
| `id`          | Unique rider ID   |
| `first`       | First name        |
| `last`        | Last name         |
| `username`    | Rider username    |
| `total_trips` | Total trips taken |

### Table: `cars`

| Column            | Description           |
| ----------------- | --------------------- |
| `id`              | Unique car ID         |
| `model`           | Vehicle model         |
| `status`          | Active or inactive    |
| `trips_completed` | Total trips completed |

## 🧠 Analytical Questions

1. How are trips, riders, and cars related?
2. How can trip records be enriched with rider and vehicle information?
3. What is the average cost of a Lyft trip?
4. Which riders are considered irregular users?
5. How many cars are currently active?
6. Which vehicles have been used the most?

## ⚙️ SQL Queries & Results

### 1️⃣ Exploring the Tables

```sql
SELECT * FROM trips;
SELECT * FROM riders;
SELECT * FROM cars;
```

**Result:** Confirmed schema, primary keys, and relationships across tables.

---

### 2️⃣ Cross Join Exploration

```sql
SELECT *
FROM riders
CROSS JOIN cars;
```

**Result:** Produced all rider–car combinations; not useful for analysis, but helpful to understand join behaviour.

---

### 3️⃣ Trip Log with Rider Details (LEFT JOIN)

```sql
SELECT *
FROM trips
LEFT JOIN riders
  ON trips.rider_id = riders.id;
```

**Result:** Created a complete trip log while preserving all trip records, even when rider data may be missing.

---

### 4️⃣ Linking Trips to Cars (INNER JOIN)

```sql
SELECT *
FROM trips
JOIN cars
  ON trips.car_id = cars.id;
```

**Result:** Successfully linked each trip to the vehicle used.

---

### 5️⃣ Adding New Riders (UNION)

```sql
SELECT * FROM riders
UNION
SELECT * FROM riders2;
```

**Result:** Combined existing and new rider datasets into a unified table.

---

### 6️⃣ Average Trip Cost

```sql
SELECT AVG(cost) AS average_cost
FROM trips;
```

**Result:** Calculated the average cost per Lyft trip.

---

### 7️⃣ Most-Used Cars

```sql
SELECT *
FROM cars
ORDER BY trips_completed DESC;
```

**Result:** Identified the vehicles with the highest usage, supporting maintenance and recall decisions.

---

## 📈 Key Insights

* Joins are essential for transforming raw trip data into meaningful operational views.
* LEFT JOINs ensure no trip data is lost when enriching with rider details.
* INNER JOINs are ideal when only fully matched records are required.
* Vehicle usage metrics can inform fleet maintenance and safety decisions.

---

## 🧰 Skills Demonstrated

* Table relationships and primary keys
* `LEFT JOIN`, `INNER JOIN`, and `CROSS JOIN`
* Combining datasets with `UNION`
* Aggregate functions (`AVG`)
* Translating relational data into business insights
