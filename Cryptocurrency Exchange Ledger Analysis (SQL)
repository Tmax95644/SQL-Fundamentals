# Cryptocurrency Exchange Ledger Analysis (SQL)

## 📌 Project Overview

Fiddy Cent is a digital currency exchange headquartered in Neo Tokyo, brokering exchanges of Bitcoin (BIT), Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin Cash (BCC), and Litecoin (LTC) against fiat currencies across ~50 countries.

This project analyzes **January 2018 transaction ledger data** using SQL aggregate functions to better understand transaction volumes, currency dominance, and daily trends in money flowing into and out of the exchange.

The analysis focuses on a single `transactions` table containing both **money-in (buy)** and **money-out (sell)** records.

## 🗂 Dataset Description

**Table:** `transactions`

| Column      | Description                                |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `id`        | Unique transaction ID                      |
| `user_id`   | User identifier                            |
| `date`      | Transaction date (YYYY-MM-DD)              |
| `currency`  | Cryptocurrency traded (BIT, ETH, BCC, LTC) |
| `money_in`  | USD value of cryptocurrency purchased      |
| `money_out` | USD value of cryptocurrency sold           |

Note: Each transaction records either `money_in` **or** `money_out`.

## 🧠 Analytical Questions

1. What columns exist in the transactions table?
2. What is the total value of money flowing **into** the exchange?
3. What is the total value of money flowing **out** of the exchange?
4. Does Bitcoin dominate transaction activity?
5. What was the largest transaction and was it a buy or sell?
6. What is the average money-in amount for Ethereum transactions?
7. How do average daily money-in and money-out values change over time?

## ⚙️ SQL Queries & Results

### 1️⃣ Inspect the Full Table

```sql
SELECT *
FROM transactions;
```

**Result:** Confirmed table structure and column names.

---

### 2️⃣ Total Money In (USD)

```sql
SELECT SUM(money_in) AS total_transactions_in
FROM transactions;
```

**Result:** **$17,173** total money flowed into the exchange.

---

### 3️⃣ Total Money Out (USD)

```sql
SELECT SUM(money_out) AS total_transactions_out
FROM transactions;
```

**Result:** **$33,417** total money flowed out of the exchange.

---

### 4️⃣ Bitcoin Transaction Dominance

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_transactions
FROM transactions;
```

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_bitcoin_transactions
FROM transactions
WHERE currency LIKE '%BIT%';
```

**Result:**

* Total transactions: **100**
* Bitcoin transactions: **42**

➡️ Bitcoin represents **42%** of all transactions.

---

### 5️⃣ Largest Transaction

```sql
SELECT MAX(money_in) AS largest_money_in
FROM transactions;
```

```sql
SELECT MAX(money_out) AS largest_money_out
FROM transactions;
```

**Result:**

* Largest money-in: **$6,000**
* Largest money-out: **$15,047**

➡️ The largest transaction was a **money-out (sell)**.

---

### 6️⃣ Average Ethereum Buy Value

```sql
SELECT AVG(money_in)
FROM transactions
WHERE currency LIKE '%ETH%';
```

**Result:** Average ETH money-in = **$131.89**

---

### 7️⃣ Daily Ledger Summary

```sql
SELECT 
  date,
  ROUND(AVG(money_in), 2) AS avg_money_in,
  ROUND(AVG(money_out), 2) AS avg_money_out
FROM transactions
GROUP BY date;
```

**Result (Selected Highlights):**

| Date       | Avg Money In ($) | Avg Money Out ($) |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| 2018-01-25 | 83.60            | 2,243.43          |
| 2018-01-28 | 136.80           | 2,059.00          |
| 2018-01-31 | 2,073.80         | 340.20            |

## 📈 Key Insights

* Bitcoin is the most frequently traded currency, accounting for **42%** of transactions.
* Total money-out significantly exceeds money-in, indicating high sell-side activity during this period.
* Several extreme outliers (notably LTC and BIT sells) heavily influence daily averages.
* End-of-month activity (Jan 31) shows unusually high average money-in values, suggesting market volatility or large institutional trades.

---

## 🧰 Skills Demonstrated

* SQL aggregate functions (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, `MAX`)
* Filtering with `WHERE`
* Grouping with `GROUP BY`
* Data formatting with `ROUND`
* Analytical interpretation of transactional data

---

## 🚀 Next Improvements

* Separate buy vs sell ledgers explicitly
* Add currency-level daily breakdowns
* Visualize trends using Power BI or Python
* Detect and handle outliers more formally
