# Twitch Gaming Data Analysis (SQL)

## 📌 Project Overview

Twitch is the world’s leading live streaming platform for gamers, with millions of daily active users. Understanding viewer behaviour, game popularity, and engagement patterns is a core responsibility of the Twitch Data Science team.

This project analyzes Twitch **stream viewing data** and **chat usage data** to uncover insights about:

* Popular games and platforms
* Viewer geography
* Viewing behaviour over time
* Game categorisation by genre
* Relationships between streaming and chat activity

The dataset contains **~6,000 records** split across two tables and mirrors real-world analytics challenges faced by streaming platforms.

## 🧠 Analytical Questions

1. What games and channels dominate Twitch viewership?
2. Which countries contribute the most viewers to top games?
3. What platforms do viewers use to watch streams?
4. How can games be categorised into meaningful genres?
5. How does viewership change throughout the day?
6. What insights can be gained by joining stream and chat data?

## ⚙️ SQL Queries & Results

### 1️⃣ Initial Data Exploration

```sql
SELECT * FROM stream LIMIT 20;
SELECT * FROM chat LIMIT 20;
```

**Result:** Confirmed schema, column names, and data types for both tables.

---

### 2️⃣ Unique Games & Channels

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT game FROM stream;
SELECT DISTINCT channel FROM stream;
```

**Result:** Identified a diverse set of games, with recurring channels driving the majority of traffic.

---

### 3️⃣ Most Popular Games

```sql
SELECT game, COUNT(*) AS total_views
FROM stream
GROUP BY game
ORDER BY total_views DESC;
```

**Result:**

* **League of Legends** dominates viewership
* Followed by **Dota 2**, **CS:GO**, and **DayZ**

---

### 4️⃣ League of Legends Viewer Geography

```sql
SELECT country, COUNT(*) AS viewer_count
FROM stream
WHERE game = 'League of Legends'
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY viewer_count DESC;
```

**Result:**

* The **United States** is the largest viewer base
* Strong international presence across Europe and Asia

---

### 5️⃣ Viewing Platforms

```sql
SELECT player, COUNT(*)
FROM stream
GROUP BY player
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;
```

**Result:**

* Web and mobile platforms dominate
* Significant usage across **site**, **iphone**, and **android**

---

### 6️⃣ Game Genre Classification

```sql
SELECT
  game,
  CASE
    WHEN game IN ('League of Legends', 'Dota 2', 'Heroes of the Storm') THEN 'MOBA'
    WHEN game = 'Counter-Strike: Global Offensive' THEN 'FPS'
    WHEN game IN ('DayZ', 'ARK: Survival Evolved') THEN 'Survival'
    ELSE 'Other'
  END AS genre,
  COUNT(*)
FROM stream
GROUP BY game
ORDER BY genre;
```

**Result:**

* MOBA games account for the majority of total views
* Clear genre clustering helps simplify analysis

---

### 7️⃣ Viewership by Hour of Day

```sql
SELECT strftime('%H', time) AS hour,
       COUNT(*) AS view_count
FROM stream
GROUP BY hour
ORDER BY hour;
```

**Result:**

* Viewership peaks between **12:00–15:00** and **18:00–22:00**
* Lowest activity occurs in early morning hours

---

### 8️⃣ Joining Stream & Chat Data

```sql
SELECT *
FROM stream
JOIN chat
  ON stream.device_id = chat.device_id;
```

**Result:**

* Enabled combined analysis of viewing and chat behaviour
* Demonstrates how engagement extends beyond passive viewing

---

## 📈 Key Insights

* **League of Legends** is by far the most-watched game globally
* Twitch viewership is highly international, with strong US dominance
